# stripped
stripped is a very stripped (heh) down boilerplate that i use for the majority of my project starts. it includes pretty much nothing but the (in my opinion) bare essentials for the majority of the small projects i work on. if you've ever wanted a really basic, easy to setup front end boilerplate that isn't full of crap, this could be the best day of your life.
